## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="copy">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start the preview server" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live\!

    <Tip>
      Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion title="Publish your docs" icon="rocket">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments\!
</Accordion>
